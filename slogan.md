Buy my time is a platform that enables users to buy someone's time.
Say you are learning a new language and you need to practice it.
You could try to begin a conversation with a stranger on a chat room but, chances are, that he or she would take it as a sexual approach or maybe even that it could be a criminal.
Perhaps you are studying math and need some help from a teacher just to solve that annoying equation that is taking you so much time, or maybe you would like the help from a cook to tell you why your cake didn't bake well.
Imagine if you could browse a list of people that matches what you need and pay them to talk to you.
The app can handle the transaction between you and the person you chose so that both partners wouldn't need to trust each other.
After the conversation you could rate the person so that others would know how satisfied you became with the service.
